Given the current worldwide issues, increasing inflation rates, and growing uncertainties regarding the value of cryptocurrencies, I thought I'd take a look at the twitter activities and sentiment of tweets posted in regards to Bitcoin. For this purpose, I have decided to analyze the tweets posted from around the beginning of the year, and see how users' confidence in the cryptocurrency is evolving.


For the purpose of this project, I have analyzed the dataset of bitcoin-related tweets that is available on Kaggle and analyzed its relationship to the USD price of Bitcoin in the past 5 months.



The twitter dataset can be downloaded via https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kevsde/bitcoin-tweets , and the dataset of Bitcoin prices of the period of this study was acquired through the website of Yahoo Finance.
